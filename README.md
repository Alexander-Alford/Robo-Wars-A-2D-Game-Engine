# Robo Wars

Robo wars is a 2D platformer made in C with SDL2 and several extensions. SDL2 provides functionality for taking keyboard input, rendering graphics to a window, and several other useful tools and is extended with the SDL Mixer and SDL Image libraries for playing sounds and rendering common image formats. The game engine has the player control a robot and navigate them around a level full of enemies. The levels and enemies are generated based on input text files whose data defines what platforms and enemies are made and where. The collision detection and resolution system allows player character and enemies can interact with the platforms and explore the map.
